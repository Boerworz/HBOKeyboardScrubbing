# HBOKeyboardScrubbing
A super simple Chrome extension that allows you to jump backwards/forwards a few seconds in the HBO player using the left and right arrow keys, just like on Netflix.

## Installation
The extension is currently only available in an unpacked version. To install it, perform the following steps:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) in Chrome.
3. Check the `Developer mode` checkbox.
4. Click `Load unpacked extensionâ€¦`.
5. Select the `HBOKeyboardScrubbing` directory.

The extension should now have been added to the list of installed extensions. Make sure you reload any HBO tabs that were open before the extension was installed.

## Usage

Press the **left arrow key** when in the player to _rewind_ 5 seconds.

Press the **right arrow key** when in the player to _fast-forward_ 5 seconds.

Hold _Shift_ when pressing either of the arrow keys to increase the duration to 15 seconds.

## Disclaimer

This exension was developed in an evening after binge-watching Parks and Recreation and being frustrated with the lack of keyboard scrubbing support. It has only been tested on HBO Nordic in Chrome 59.0.3071.115 for Mac OS X and I can't guarantee that it'll work for anyone else but me.
